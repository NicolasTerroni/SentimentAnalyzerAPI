# SentimentAnalyzerAPI
SentimentAnalyzerAPI is a fast and efficient API built using FastAPI and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of text data. With just a simple HTTP request, users can gain valuable insights into the sentiment of their text, helping them understand the emotions conveyed within their content.

This is a fast-built project for a friend who needed an API to analyze comments on his e-commerce. He asked it to be dockerized.

You can start the app with
docker compose up --build
